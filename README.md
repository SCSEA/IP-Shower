# What is an IP Address?

An Internet Protocol (IP) address is the unique number that gets assigned to your connected device. Every mobile phone, laptop, cable box, tablet, server along with thousands of other types of devices (IoT) that are connected to a computer network has one.

# What is IP Geolocation?

IP geolocation is the science of determining the physical location and Internet connection characteristics of a web visitor. Much like how a street address identifies where you live, an IP address functions as the identifying "street address" of the device and allows companies to see where the device is located and route traffic to the nearest server for faster connections and lower latency. No Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is required, and our data is fully compliant with all privacy mandates including GDPR and CCPA.
